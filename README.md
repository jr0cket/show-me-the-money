# show-me-the-money

A Clojure library to calculate your salary after all the relevant taxes are removed, so that when you are evaluating the next opportunity you can decide if perminant or contract work would be more lucrative.

For a perminant person this would be income tax & national insurance and self assessment taxes should you earn a decent salary.

For a contractor this could be a range of things including income tax, national insurance, corporation tax, self assesment, indeminty insurance, etc.

The library should provide a comparison between perminant and contract work.  For example, given a daily rate, what would be the equivalent perminant salary (assuming you are working X number of weeks in the year).  The comparison should also include how much of they year you need to work at the current rate to earn as much as perminant.

## Usage

This is intended to be a library, so fire up a Clojure REPL and require or change into the namespace.
